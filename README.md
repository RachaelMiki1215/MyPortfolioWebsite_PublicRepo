## Disclaimer
This repo exists as a means of demonstration, and therefore:
- API keys / passwords are omitted from the code.
- Is not used for CI/CD.
- There exists a private repository in which all of the version management and CI/CD is done.

## Plausible Questions
1. Why are the API keys / passwords written directly in CockroachDB.cs instead of appsettings.json or some .env file?
   - At the time I was actively developing this website, as a noob, I was not aware of many general practices.
   - Planning to put API keys / passwords in appsettings.json for the next rendition of this website.
2. Why isn't Entity Framework Core (EF Core) used if it is a .NET web app connecting to a database?
   - As a noob, I did not have the slightest idea to use itü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
   - Will be using EF Core for the next rendition of my website.

Finally, please feel free to contact me if there are any questions or comments.
